# Personalized Community Feed (내 취향 피드)

A taste-driven reader that pulls "best" posts and news from across many
communities and shows you only the ones that fit *you* — instead of a plain
aggregator's community-by-community, page-by-page list.

It solves the pain points of existing aggregators:

- **Community-by-community tabs → one personalized stream.** You don't hop
  between boards; the feed blends every source and ranks by your taste.
- **Clunky pagination → smooth infinite scroll.** No page numbers, no reload
  jank. New items stream in as you scroll.
- **Losing your place → exact back-restore.** Open a post, press back, and you
  return to the *exact* pixel you left from (`history.scrollRestoration` is set
  to manual and the feed DOM is kept mounted under a detail overlay).

## How taste is learned

```text
warm-start (browsing history)  ┐
onboarding survey              ┼─→ preference vector ─→ ranking ─→ feed
like / dislike feedback  ──────┘        ▲                              │
                                        └──────── online learning ◀────┘
```

1. **Warm start from browsing history (optional).** Paste the community
   domains / post titles you usually visit. `history.js` maps hosts → sources
   and title keywords → categories/tags to infer an initial taste vector.
   Only hosts and titles are used; nothing is fetched or stored.
2. **Onboarding survey.** A few multi-select questions (interests, favorite
   communities, tone, depth, topics to avoid) seed the preference vector. The
   survey folds the warm-start signal in at a reduced weight so explicit
   answers lead.
3. **Feedback loop.** Every 👍 / 👎 nudges the category, tag, and source weights
   (`applyFeedback`, a small-step online update with gentle decay). The feed
   sharpens as you use it.
4. **Specialization level.** `specializationLevel()` estimates how well we know
   you (0–1) from feature coverage, weight contrast, and feedback volume. It
   drives the phase shown in the header: `탐색 중` → `학습 중` → `맞춤 완성`.

## Scoring

`scoreItem()` combines, per item:

- category weight + averaged tag weight + source weight (the learned taste)
- a longform-vs-quick style match against the item's length
- a log-scaled popularity prior (so "클리앙/뽐뿌 인기글" still surface)
- a deterministic novelty jitter (varies the feed without `Math.random`)
- a strong penalty for already-seen items

The engine only ever hands out *unseen* items, so the infinite scroll never
repeats within a session.

## Sources

Content comes from pluggable **sources** — any object with
`{ id, kind, async fetch() }`. Bundled:

- `SeedSource` — offline seed dataset (`seed-data.js`), always available, spans
  news + community across categories including 자동차, 유머, IT, 스포츠, etc.
- `JsonSource(id, loader)` — wrap any async loader (an internal community DB, a
  proxied API) that returns raw items.

Add an RSS or community adapter by conforming to the same shape and routing raw
items through `normalizeItem()`.

## Community registry (resource DB)

Sources are defined as data in [`src/feed/communities.json`](../src/feed/communities.json),
not code — adding a community is a new row. Each entry carries `country`,
`lang`, `category`, `size`, `adult`, and an `adapter` (`seed` | `rss` | `reddit`
| `json`). `registry.js` loads it and `buildSources()` turns enabled entries
into runnable sources:

- `seed` entries read the bundled offline dataset (runs with no network).
- non-`seed` entries need a `fetcher(entry)` injected at runtime; without one
  they stay registered but yield nothing, so the app is always runnable while
  ready to wire live ingestion.

The DB already registers domestic communities (large and small), overseas
boards (Reddit, Hacker News, 5ch, …), and adult boards.

## Overseas translation

`TranslatingSource` wraps any source and localizes items whose `lang` differs
from the reader's target. The translator is **injected** (provider-agnostic,
dependency-free). Without one, foreign items are passed through and flagged
`needsTranslation` so the UI labels them (`원문`) instead of silently showing a
foreign-language post; with one, items are translated and flagged `번역` with
the original title preserved. `memoizedTranslator()` caches so re-collection
never re-translates the same string.

## Periodic DB update

`engine.startAutoRefresh(intervalMs)` re-collects every source on an interval
and swaps the pool atomically. Because item ids are **content-stable**
(`stableId` in `content.js`), ratings and comments keep pointing at the right
posts across refreshes. Enable on the server with `FEED_REFRESH_MS`.

## Posting + 내 공간 (my space)

Users can post (`POST /api/post`) — a post becomes a first-class feed item
(`source: "me"`) via `StorePostsSource`, so the space behaves like a community
built for you. `GET /api/me` returns everything you've created or reacted to
(posts, comments, like/dislike tallies) for integrated management.

## 19금 (adult) gate

Adult items are filtered out server-side unless the user is **both**
age-verified (`POST /api/verify-age`) **and** has the toggle on
(`POST /api/adult`). The gate is enforced in the engine for both the feed and
single-item fetch, so an unverified client can never pull an adult item.

## API

| Method + path            | Purpose                                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `GET  /api/config`       | survey definition + categories + sources       |
| `GET  /api/communities`  | community registry DB + summary                |
| `POST /api/session`      | create/resume a user, returns `userId`         |
| `POST /api/history`      | warm-start from `{ entries: [...] }`           |
| `POST /api/survey`       | save `{ answers }` and seed preferences        |
| `GET  /api/feed`         | next unseen batch (`userId`, `cursor`, `limit`)|
| `GET  /api/item`         | one item + its comment thread                  |
| `POST /api/rate`         | `{ itemId, signal }` — signal ∈ {-1, 0, 1}     |
| `POST /api/comment`      | `{ itemId, body }`                             |
| `POST /api/post`         | create a user post `{ title, summary, category }` |
| `GET  /api/me`           | my space: my posts, comments, ratings          |
| `POST /api/verify-age`   | age verification (mock; wire PASS/본인확인)     |
| `POST /api/adult`        | toggle the 19금 view `{ on }` (requires verify) |

## Run it

```bash
npm run feed                          # in-memory, http://localhost:4000
PORT=4000 FEED_DB=./feed-data.json npm run feed   # persist users to a JSON file
FEED_REFRESH_MS=900000 npm run feed               # re-collect the DB every 15 min
```

Open the URL, take the survey (or warm-start with history), then scroll, rate,
and comment. State persists per browser via a `userId` in `localStorage`.
